**Acceptability of an adventure video game in the treatment of female adolescents with symptoms of depression** [Link](https://www.researchinpsychotherapy.org/index.php/rpsy/article/view/182)\
A research project designed an online adventure video game that would function as a psychotherapeutic tool for depressed adolescents. Five psychotherapists and fifteen female adolescents with symptoms of depression tested the game.\
Psychotherapists provided their patients the online system via an access code. Upon the patients registering, they were sent an e-mail to verify their registration, then they would be given an access code. The researchers would be informed when a patient had completed the game and what in-game decisions they made. Additionally, the psychotherapists evaluated the state of the patients and, if they chose to do it, talked about their experience with the game and how it related to their real-life problems.\
The study resulted in nine of the thirteen patients reporting positive feedback such as the content of the game’s story mirroring life situations, relationships in life, healthy and unhealthy behavior, social engagement, and ecological sensitivity. The tool was proven to be useful based on their psychotherapies.\
The most important takeaway from this study was that video games designed for mental health can be worthwhile. While the game was described as “simple”, it shows that games that feature interactive devices and artificial intelligence can offer many possibilities for education and mental health.

**The Efficacy of Playing Videogames Compared with Antidepressants in Reducing Treatment-Resistant Symptoms of Depression**[Link](https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/full/10.1089/g4h.2019.0032)\
A month-long controlled study was conducted to compare the effectiveness in reduing treatment-resistant depression symptoms (TRDS) and improve heart rate variability (HRV). This was done in two different methods: perscribing a second antidepressant (sAD) and a prescribed regimen of a casual video game like Plant vs. Zombies (PvZ).\
In this test, all participants were actively taking a prescribed antidepressant and expressed they were still experiencing symptoms of depression. The group was given the option between an sAD and a commercial video game (CVG), in this test they played PvZ. The sAD group were told to refrain from playing CVGs for one month instead they would surf the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) website which had information on how to overcome symtoms of depression. The PvZ group were given instructions by a researcher during their game sessions.\
The results of this experiment showed that the group playing PvZ was significantly more effective in reducing TRDS than the sAD group however both groups showed drops in TRDS.

**The impact of explicit mental health messages in video games on players' motivation and affect** [Link](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0747563218300256?casa_token=_hNfCS2m_zwAAAAA:hGvYX41ylgwjO1JkS4_H3Nv_4tHa36nNJYtrYd2RATb_UGz9n7vuM7Yab2mwvttAya-OU3AO)\
This procdure of this experiment involved a questionnaire of self-reported depressive symtoms prior to playing the game. Once done, one of two trailers would be shown to the player. The trailer either had a focus on the entertainment aspect of the game or it would focus more on the mental health aspect of the game. Both trailers had similar content, the only difference was the text shown on screen. They would then proceed to play the game WAY with a player in another room.\
The results of this experiment showed that introducing a game as benificial to mental health did not decrease the intrinsic motivation to play the game when compared to the entertainment trailer. However, people experiencing more depressive symtoms experienced stronger positive changes in their emotional state and a better connection with their partner during gameplay when compared to those people with less depressive symtoms.\
What was interesting is when the group of people with more depressive symptoms watched the mental health focused trailer they showed less competence and in effect felt more discouraged to play the game. 

**Video Games and Their Impact on Teens' Mental Health** [Link](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-69638-6_17)\
Today the influence of video games on teenagers has grown as they become more accessible through devices such as computers, smartphones, and game consoles. This paper reviews trends in video games and explores the motivations behind teens who play these games. After that, it reviews the literature regarding the influence of playing different types of commercial video games on mental health.\
It was revealed that action is the most popular video game genre. The trend found in what motivated the teens to play video games is the state of competition, challenge, diversion, fantasy, social interaction, and arousal. Across all the test subjects, video games that enable the player to experience mastery through cognitive effort were the most motivating games, the researchers hypothesized this may be the case because these types of games result in a highly pleasurable state called “flow”. This term is described as “an intrinsically rewarding state of highly focused concentration leading to a decreased sense of time and self-awareness and a perception of seamless control between thought and action”.\
The paper concludes that entertainment games have demonstrated positive effects on adolescent mental health and that this trend is likely to only grow stronger as there is evidence suggesting the therapeutic benefits of integrating video games into treatment with teens.

**Video games as a complementary therapy tool in mental disorders: PlayMancer, a European multicentre study** [Link](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.3109/09638237.2012.664302)\
This paper was conducted to develop and evaluate a serious video game designed to remediate attitudinal, behavioral, and emotional processes of patients with impulse-related disorders.\
Project PlayMancer developed a video game aiming to prove potential capacity to change in underlying processes of patients with impulse-related disorders. They used components such as emotion recognition from speech, face, and psychological reactions that the game would then provide biofeedback to the patients to learn relaxation skills, acquire better self-control and develop new emotional regulation strategies. For example, if high undesired emotional reactions such as anger or inpulsiveness was detected, the game would guide the player to a more relaxing area. The game featured a setting with multiple “islands” were each island offered different activities with varying difficulties. These activities included were designed to improve skills and attitudes that needed to change such as problem solving, impulse control, confrontation with situations involving frustration.\
The conclusion derived from this research was that this approach was a good platform to work out more difficult problems in mental health: underlying and attitudinal and emotional problems. These underlying problems are expressed through the form of impulsiveness or frustration. The game aims to offer ways to deal with these issues in an intensive and motivating way.
