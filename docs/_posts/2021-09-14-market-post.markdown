*What relevant market sectors does my research potentially fall into?*\
My research falls mainly in the sector of doctors, psychiatrists to be more specific. These doctors focus on “the diagnosis, treatment and prevention of mental, emotional and behavioral disorders”. Additionally, physicians are also a common doctor that fall into the market as many of these doctors work with children patients and much of the research done on video games and how it affects mental health is observed most with their impact on developing children. 
Aside from doctors, the audience is comprised mainly of gamers. There is more than 2.5 billion gamers around the world today with 38% of US gamers between the ages 18 and 34. It's also estimated that 26% of Americans ages 18 and older suffer from diagnosable mental diorders in a given year, that's about 1 in 4 American Adults.\
