*A description of your primary audience. Where do these people work or spend their time?*\
My primary audience that is most affected by my research are most commonly young adults who own a home and have children. The people that are doing the most research are user research leads and professors studying how video games can be used as therapy as well as the benefits it serves to the common gamer in regards to mental health.

*What responsibilities do members of your audience have?*\
The responsibilities of a user research lead is to create, improve and optimise user research and team processes; optimise human and material resources allocation based on study requests. They collaborate with other team lead and user research project managers for resource management, support etc.

*What challenges do they face?*\
The challenges they face are hiring psychologists or folks with a background in psychology. It’s stated that the psychological principles to game design are still in infancy (Link). Their roles in game design lie in user research, specifically researching if users are experiencing the games the developers intended to have them experience. 

*What do your customers value most?*\
Customers appear to value the user experience the most, the goal to truly design a game that “does what it was designed to do” in this case, giving insight on mental health. Additionally, it’s important to note that the research teams work closely with people who suffer from different types of mental illnesses. The company *For the Records* states they made their games to “increase the understanding of mental health disorders by providing a space for shared experiences” to more accurately portray the effects of mental disorders through their games.

*What kind of resources (eg, funding) do they have at their disposal?*\
There appears to be a lack of funding when it comes to specifically mental health and video games. Many research papers I have come across have been mostly independent studies. The only big names that I’ve come across in my research only talked about the effects on mental health when it came to user experience. It however didn’t focus on specific cases such as anxiety or depression instead it focused on the “good feeling” gamers experience when playing big name titles. They appear to care more about accessibility through consoles, PC, and mobile devices as well as what techniques they can incorporate into their games to gain more sales. Mobile games are being designed to encourage short-term daily use over more deep and immersive play experiences. This is believed to be done to increase adherence to their consumers, to increase the commitment of their consumers to the product.
