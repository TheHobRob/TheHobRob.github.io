# Welcome

For this week I started my basic dev experiments. I centered my experiment on the most accessible and effective way to measure the effects of a video game on the player. During my research, I grew curious about the tools used that provided biofeedback during gameplay. Some instruments used were biosensors like galvanic skin response, heart rate, skin temperature, and breathing frequency. Other ways results were measured was through questionnaires before and after an experiment to see the effects of a player’s state of mind. These results make me lose some confidence as the biosensors used were designed for the experiments. I don’t know how accessible they are to an undergraduate student much less a student in a non-medical field. Nonetheless, my other option involves a different form of biosensors maybe with the use of a camera that is more accessible or through questionnaires.
